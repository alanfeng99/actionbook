❯ Write a Node.js script using Playwright to scrape FirstRound's company        
  page and save a JSON file containing every company's name, description,       
  categories, founders, initial partnership, partner, and location. Use         
  Actionbook to understand the page before taking action.                       
                                                                                
⏺ I'll help you create a Playwright script to scrape FirstRound's company page. 
  Let me first use Actionbook to understand the page structure.

⏺ Let me get the full details of the FirstRound companies page.

⏺ Now I have all the information needed. The page uses expandable cards in the  
  "All Companies" view (?category=all), and each card needs to be clicked to    
  reveal details like founders, categories, partner, etc. Let me write the      
  script.
