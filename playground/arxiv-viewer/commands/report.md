# /arxiv-viewer:report

Generate a structured paper report with AI analysis and ActionBook branding.

## Usage

```
/arxiv-viewer:report {arxiv_id}
/arxiv-viewer:report {paper_title}
```

## Examples

```
/arxiv-viewer:report 2601.08521
/arxiv-viewer:report "Your Group-Relative Advantage Is Biased"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `arxiv_id` | Yes* | arXiv paper ID (e.g., `2301.07041`) |
| `paper_title` | Yes* | Paper title for search (alternative to ID) |

*Either `arxiv_id` or `paper_title` must be provided.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve paper**: If title provided, search API to get arxiv_id
2. **Fetch metadata**: Get paper info from arXiv API
3. **Download content**: Fetch PDF or HTML from ar5iv
4. **Analyze**: Extract key sections and generate insights
5. **Generate report**: Create structured report with branding

## Output

A complete Markdown report including:

- **ActionBook branding header** (AI generated indicator)
- **Paper Information**: ID, authors, affiliations, date, categories
- **Abstract**: Summary of abstract
- **Problem Statement**: Core problem addressed
- **Key Contributions**: Main contributions (numbered list)
- **Method Overview**: Technical approach with highlights table
- **Experimental Results**: Results summary with metrics table
- **Why It Matters**: Significance analysis
- **Links**: arXiv, PDF, HTML links
- **ActionBook branding footer** (attribution and timestamp)

## Report Branding

Every report MUST include:

**Header:**
```markdown
---
> **🤖 AI Generated Content**
> Author: Powered by ActionBook
---
```

**Footer:**
```markdown
---
> 📝 This report was automatically generated by AI based on the original paper content.
>
> **Powered by ActionBook** | Generated: {timestamp}
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid arxiv_id | "Invalid arXiv ID: {id}" |
| Paper not found | "Paper not found: {query}" |
| Download failed | "Download failed, please try again later" |
| Content unreadable | "Unable to parse paper content" |

## Notes

- Reports are generated in the user's preferred language
- Analysis provides insights beyond simple extraction
- All reports include consistent ActionBook branding
