# CLI Reference

The Actionbook CLI (`actionbook`) is the primary interface for interacting with Actionbook.

## `actionbook search`

Search for available action manuals.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook search [query]
```

**Arguments:**

- `query`: The search keyword (e.g., "airbnb", "google login").

```

## `actionbook get`

Retrieve a specific action manual by its ID.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook get [actionId]
```

**Arguments:**

- `actionId`: The unique identifier of the action.

**Example:**

```

## `actionbook extension`

Browser extension bridge management commands.

### `actionbook extension install`

Download and install the Chrome extension from GitHub Releases to the local config directory (`~/.config/actionbook/extension/`).

- `--force` — Reinstall even if already installed at the same or newer version

### `actionbook extension serve`

Start the WebSocket bridge server for CLI-to-browser communication.

- `--port PORT` — WebSocket port (default: `19222`)

<Note>
  This command runs in the foreground. Keep the terminal open while using extension mode.
</Note>

### `actionbook extension status`

Check if the bridge server is running.

### `actionbook extension ping`

Send a heartbeat to the bridge server and measure round-trip latency.

### `actionbook extension path`

## `actionbook browser`

Browser automation commands.

### `actionbook browser open`

Open a URL in the browser.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook browser open [url]
```

### `actionbook browser click`

Click an element on the current page.

**Usage:**

actionbook browser click [selector]
```

**Arguments:**

- `selector`: The CSS selector, XPath, or other supported selector string.

### `actionbook browser fill`

actionbook browser fill [selector] [value]
```

**Arguments:**

- `value`: The text value to input.

### Global Flags

These flags apply to all `actionbook browser` subcommands:

- `--extension` — Route browser commands through the extension bridge instead of launching a new browser. Requires `actionbook extension serve` to be running.
- `--extension-port PORT` — Bridge server port (default: `19222`). Use when running the bridge on a non-default port.
- `--json` — Output results in JSON format.
